# Linear-Regression-using-Gradient-Descent

## Gradient Descent
Gradient Descent is an algorithm to minimize the loss function by updating the 
weights and bias
W - weight matrix
b - bias 

`yh = WX + b`
where X is the input matrix

loss function `L = (1/2n) * Î£(yh - y)^2`

## Gradient Descednt equation
`Wnew = W - lr * dL/dW`
`bnew = b - lr * dL/db`
